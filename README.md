# GROMACS Scripts

These are shell scripts for setting up classical MD simulations in GROMACS. 

They are designed to automate as much of the procedure as possible, and rely on a very specific directory structure being in place as well as a particular bash profile configuration. Chances are they won't work for you - let alone anyone not operating on the University of St Andrews HPC clusters. 

In any case they make my life significantly easier.
